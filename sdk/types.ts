// The public plugin API, version 1 (design §5 › Host API). A plugin's `main` module exports
// `activate(ctx: PluginContext)` and, optionally, `deactivate()`. `ctx` is already scoped to ONE
// project window: nothing in it takes a project id, and the ids it does take (a tab, a panel) are
// only looked up inside that project by main.
//
// This file is types only, so a plugin author can depend on it without pulling in app code. A
// later minor release may add members; a breaking change bumps PLUGIN_API_VERSION, and the app
// refuses a manifest whose `api` major it does not know (src/shared/manifest.ts).
//
// The phase-1 host implements every member (src/host/ctx/). The page side of panels is the panel SDK
// (src/sdk/panel.ts, loaded as `/__sdk/panel.js`).
